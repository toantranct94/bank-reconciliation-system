## Introduction

#### Architecture

#### Code structure

#### Key libraries & Frameworks

To build such a service, I used the following libraries and frameworks:

- FastAPI: a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

- PostgreSQL: a powerful, open source object-relational database system.

- RabbitMQ: a message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

- Nginx: a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.
